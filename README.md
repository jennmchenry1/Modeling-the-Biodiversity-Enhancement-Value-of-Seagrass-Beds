# Modeling-the-Biodiversity-Enhancement-Value-of-Seagrass-Beds

Code supporting the publication McHenry, J. et al. 20XX. Modeling the biodiversity enhancement value of seagrass beds. Journal TBD.

Files 
A. seagrass_stack.rds -> a raster stack of mapped predictions for the total cover and species composition of seagrass beds under current conditions (2017-2020) and at 2100 under two sea level rise senarios (i.e., +0.5m and +1.0m). 
B. faunal_biodiversity_stack.rds -> a raster stack of mapped predictions for the faunal biodiversity of shallow water and deep water seagrass beds under current conditions (2017-2020) and at 2100 under two sea level rise senarios (i.e., +0.5m and +1.0m).
C. BEV_stack.rds -> a raster stack of mapped predictions for the biodiversity enhancement value (BEV) of shallow water and deep water seagrass beds for three scenarios 1) current BEV, 3) BEV with restoraiton, and 4) BEV with sea level rise.
